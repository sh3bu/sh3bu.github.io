As you can see there are 2 ports open :

**Port 80** - `http ` - ` Microsoft IIS httpd 10.0`

**Port 3389** - `ms-wbt-server` -  `Microsoft Terminal Services`

**Web Enumeration**

Visitinng the webpage at port 80, we get a `default IIS  page` 👇🏻

To enumerate the hidden directories , I used **ffuf**


```bash
┌──(shebu㉿kali)-[~/Desktop/thm/retro]
└─$ ffuf -c -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/medium.txt -u http://retro.thm/FUZZ -fc 403,404 -fs 703

**Qn 1 🎯- What is the hidden directory which the website lives on?** - `/retro `

 
## Shell as Wade -
____________________________________________________

On visiting the `/retro` directory we get this webpage  👇🏻

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628497851032/m91ozeahl.png)
 
Seems like a fancy looking blog page .Taking a close look at the page , you can see that the author of the blog posts is `Wade` 

**Wade** might possibly be a username which may come handy later .Lets note it down and enumerate further !

While looking at all the posts ,one particular post is quite interesting 👇🏻

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628498192898/LmlCC_-F0.png)

This posts has some comments on it !

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628498336717/tVhZoC5NM.png)

Could that be Wade's password? Let's try logging in using xfreerdp !


```bash
xfreerdp /u:wade /p:parzival /cert:ignore /v:retro.thm
``` 
And we're in !!

## Shell as administrator -
____________________________________________________

The first thing I checked was **recycle bin** , It contained `hhupd.exe` file .

> hhupd.exe is an executable file that is part of the Microsoft Press Computer-Lexikon program developed by Microsoft Press .


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628501313225/yrffg7Hay.png)

The next thing I noticed is there was **Google Chrome** shortcut in desktop which was weird !  
Opening Chrome , we could see that the author of the box has a bookmark called **NVD-CVE-2019-1388** 

![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628499422018/d61jwREHl.png)

Maybe this is  what we need inorder to escalate out privileges to root !
 So the CVE is `CVE-2019-1388`


![image.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1628501345278/tt0bOdAxv.png)

Lets use some google fu to read more on this vulnerability ,

**This blog post explains it in quite detailed and clear manner on how to exploit this vulnerability -**

> https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2019/11/19/thanksgiving-treat-easy-as-pie-windows-7-secure-desktop-escalation-of-privilege

For this exploit to work we need to have `hhupd.exe` application on our system , which we already found in recycle bin .Restore the application and follow the steps as mentioned in the blog post .


```bash
1. Run the "hhupd.exe" application as administrator
2. Click on "Show more details" arrow
3. Click the link "Show information about this publisher's certificate"
4. Click the link  "VeriSign Commercial Software Publishers CA"
5. Now the certificate issuer's website should have been opened on internet explorer!
6. Press "CTRL+S" to save the webpage , a dialog box appears 
7. Type "cmd.exe" on the File name box and hit ENTER !

Voila ! We get a command prompt with admin privileges !
```
